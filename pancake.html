    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Large Eggs</li>
            <li>1 Cup (227g) Milk</li>
            <li>2 Teaspoons Pure Vanilla Extract</li>
            <li>3 Tablespoons melted butter or 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 Teaspoons Salt</li>
            <li>2 Teaspoons Baking Powder</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons Granulated Sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 Cup Blueberries, fresh or frozen</li>
            <li>1 Whole Banana</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Heat a griddle to 350°F. If you don't have a griddle, heat a large frying pan over medium-low to medium heat. Grease the griddle. When it's hot enough, a drop of water will skitter across the surface, evaporating immediately.</p></li>
            <li><p>Beat the eggs, milk, and vanilla until light and foamy, about 3 minutes at high speed of a stand or hand mixer. Stir in the melted butter or oil.</p></li>
            <li><p>Add the flour, salt, baking powder, and sugar, stirring just to combine. A few lumps are OK. Set the batter aside to rest for a couple of minutes; it'll thicken a bit as it stands. Thin the batter with additional milk if it's not pourable consistency.</p></li>
            <li><p>Drop the batter by 1/4 cupfuls onto the prepared griddle or pan; a muffin scoop works well here. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon berries atop each pancake.</p></li>
            <li><p>Cook the cakes till they're golden brown on the bottom, about 2 minutes. Flip them over, and cook till the other side is golden, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes.</p></li>
            <li><p>Serve the pancakes immediately. Or transfer them to a platter, cover, and keep warm in a 200°F oven. Enjoy with butter, sliced bananas, and maple syrup.</p></li>
        </ol>
